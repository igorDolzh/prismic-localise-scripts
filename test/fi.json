    "What is Pleo?": "Mikä Pleo on?",
    "Pleo is a centralised business spending solution for forward-thinking teams. Pleo enables employees to buy the things they need for work, while keeping companies in full control of all spending. With the help of breakthrough technology and commercial cards, Pleo eliminates expense reports, reduces administrative complexity and simplifies bookkeeping. Find out more.": "Pleo on keskitetty yrityskuluratkaisu tulevaisuuteen suuntautuneille tiimeille. Pleon avulla työntekijät voivat tehdä työhön tarvittavia ostoksia, ja samalla yrityksillä pysyvät kaikki kulut täysin hallinnassa. Pleo poistaa kuluraporttien tarpeen, vähentää hallinnon monimutkaisuutta ja yksinkertaistaa kirjanpitoa mullistavan teknologian ja yrityskorttien avulla. Lue lisää.",
    "Is Pleo suitable for us?": "Sopiiko Pleo meille?",
    "Pleo works with companies of all sizes, across every industry. What unites those businesses is that they’ve experienced the pain of traditional spend management: shared cards, chasing receipts, expense reports and reimbursements. They’re ready to move past the confusion and complexity that has defined spend management for so long. Meet our customers.": "Pleo tekee yhteistyötä kaikenkokoisten yritysten kanssa kaikilla toimialoilla. Näitä yrityksiä yhdistää se, että ne ovat kokeneet perinteisen kulujen hallinnan haasteet: jaetut kortit sekä kuittien, kuluraporttien ja hyvitysten metsästämisen. Nämä yritykset ovat valmiita jättämään menneisyyteen sekavuuden ja monimutkaisuuden, joka on jo pitkään leimannut kulujen hallintaa. Tutustu asiakkaisiimme.",
    "How do Pleo cards work?": "Miten Pleo-kortit toimivat?",
    "Pleo’s commercial cards are issued by Mastercard, meaning they’re accepted by more than 30 million merchants worldwide. The plastic Pleo cards can be used for in-store payments, contactless transactions and have a chip and pin facility. Meanwhile, Pleo virtual cards can be used to make online purchases. On top of that, you can use your Pleo card with ApplePay and Google Pay. Find out more.": "Pleon yrityskortit ovat Mastercardin myöntämiä, joten yli 30 miljoonaa kauppiasta ympäri maailman hyväksyy ne. Fyysisiä Pleo-kortteja voidaan käyttää maksuihin myymälöissä ja lähimaksuihin. Niissä on siru- ja PIN-toiminto. Pleon virtuaalisia kortteja voidaan käyttää myös verkko-ostosten tekemiseen. Lisäksi voit käyttää Pleo-korttia Apple Payn ja Google Payn kanssa. Lue lisää.",
    "Cards can be used to purchase goods or pay for services in the same way as a credit card, but you can only make transactions when there is money in your company account. With Pleo, employees catch receipts on-the-go using their phone, the system automatically categorises expenses based on previous behaviour and eliminates the need to do manual expense reports.": "Kortilla voi ostaa tavaroita tai maksaa palveluista samalla tavalla kuin luottokortilla, mutta maksutapahtumia voi suorittaa vain, kun yrityksen tilillä on rahaa. Pleon avulla työntekijät tallentavat kuitit puhelimella liikkeellä ollessaan. Järjestelmä luokittelee kulut automaattisesti aiemman toiminnan perusteella ja poistaa tarpeen tehdä manuaalisia kuluraportteja.",
    "Who is behind Pleo?": "Ketkä ovat Pleon taustalla?",
    "Pleo was founded in Copenhagen in 2015 by fintech veterans Jeppe Rindom and Niccolo Perra, both early team members of the Danish startup success, Tradeshift, with years of experience building successful financial products. Today, the Pleo team is 250-strong, with five European office locations (London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid and Copenhagen). Here’s our story.": "Pleon perustivat Kööpenhaminassa vuonna 2015 rahoitusteknologia-alan kokeneet ammattilaiset Jeppe Rindom ja Niccolo Perra. He molemmat olivat menestyksekkään tanskalaisen startup-yrityksen Tradeshiftin tiimin jäseniä alkuvaiheessa, ja heillä oli vuosien kokemus onnistuneiden rahoitustuotteiden kehittämisestä. Nykyään Pleon tiimissä on 250 työntekijää ja sillä on viisi toimipistettä Euroopassa (Lontoossa, Tukholmassa, Berliinissä, Madridissa ja Kööpenhaminassa). Tässä on tarinamme.",
    "Is Pleo a bank?": "Onko Pleo pankki?",
    "Pleo is not a bank. We’re a business spending solution that helps companies to pay for the things they need and track those transactions. We connect your Pleo account to your business bank account, so you can transfer funds as needed.": "Pleo ei ole pankki. Olemme yritysten kuluratkaisu, joka auttaa yrityksiä maksamaan tarvitsemistaan asioista ja seuraamaan kyseisiä tapahtumia. Yhdistämme Pleo-tilisi yrityksesi pankkitiliin, jotta voit siirtää varoja tarpeen mukaan.",
    "Do you offer credit?": "Tarjoatteko luottoa?",
    "We do not currently offer credit, but it’s definitely something we’re looking at for the future.": "Tällä hetkellä emme tarjoa luottoa, mutta se on ehdottomasti asia, jota harkitsemme tulevaisuudessa.",
    "Can you share a Pleo card?": "Voiko Pleo-kortin jakaa?",
    "Sharing cards makes it impossible to properly track spending and can put you at risk of fraud. So we remove the need to do it at all.": "Korttien jakaminen tekee kulujen riittävän seurannan mahdottomaksi ja voi aiheuttaa petosriskin. Siksi poistamme kokonaan tarpeen jakaa kortteja.",
    "As soon as you sign up to Pleo, our virtual cards can be issued to anyone who needs to buy something online. Spending limits also help to give you reassurance that issuing a card to someone on your team won’t put you at risk. ": "Heti kun olet rekisteröitynyt Pleoon, virtuaaliset korttimme voidaan myöntää kaikille, jotka haluavat ostaa jotain verkosta. Kulutusrajat auttavat sinua myös vakuuttumaan siitä, että kortin myöntäminen jollekin tiimisi jäsenille ei aiheuta sinulle riskejä. ",
    "Using Pleo": "Pleon käyttö",
    "How to use Pleo?": "Miten Pleoa käytetään?",
    "How can we transfer money to Pleo cards?": "Miten voimme siirtää rahaa Pleo-korteille?",
    "Your Pleo account is connected to your business bank account. So every time you add funds to Pleo, to help your team buy what they need for work, that money comes out of your business bank account. But it doesn’t go directly to us. It goes first to J.P. Morgan, or to Danske Bank for our customers in Denmark and Sweden. This means that neither we – nor anyone else – have direct access to your money. How we keep your money safe.": "Pleo-tilisi on yhdistetty yrityksesi pankkitiliin. Aina kun lisäät varoja Pleoon tiimin työostoksia varten, raha tulee yrityksesi pankkitililtä. Varat eivät kuitenkaan tule suoraan meille. Ne menevät ensin J.P. Morganille tai Tanskan ja Ruotsin asiakkaidemme tapauksessa Danske Bankille. Tämä tarkoittaa, ettei meillä eikä kellään muullakaan ole suoraa pääsyä rahoihisi. Näin pidämme rahasi turvassa.",
    "Can Pleo cards be used everywhere?": "Voiko Pleo-kortteja käyttää kaikkialla?",
    "Pleo cards can be used in more than 30 million locations worldwide, in-store and online, making corporate purchasing easy and convenient – just look for the Mastercard Acceptance Mark. You can also use your Pleo card with ApplePay and Google Pay. Find out more.": "Pleo-kortteja voi käyttää yli 30 miljoonassa paikassa ympäri maailmaa, sekä myymälöissä että verkossa. Voit tehdä hankintoja yritykselle helposti ja kätevästi – pidä vain silmällä Mastercardin hyväksynnän merkkiä. Voit käyttää Pleo-korttia myös Apple Payn ja Google Payn kanssa. Lue lisää.",
    "Do I still need to do my expense reports when using Pleo?": "Tarvitseeko minun edelleenkin tehdä kuluraportteja, kun käytän Pleoa?",
    "No. The founding idea behind Pleo is to get rid of the expense reports. When you pay for something with your Pleo card, you’ll receive an instant notification on your phone. Snap the receipt, add some basic info about what you’ve bought and that’s it. Our software will automatically categorise the purchase.": "Ei. Pleon perusajatuksena on kuluraporteista eroon pääseminen. Kun maksat jotain Pleo-kortilla, saat välittömästi ilmoituksen puhelimeesi. Kuvaa kuitti, lisää perustiedot ostoksestasi ja se on siinä. Ohjelmistomme luokittelee ostoksen automaattisesti.",
    "Managers or finance teams can monitor all transactions in real-time and flag anything that needs more information. When the time is right, transactions can be exported to the accounting system your business uses.": "Esihenkilöt tai taloustiimit voivat seurata kaikkia tapahtumia reaaliaikaisesti ja merkitä kaikki lisätietoja tarvitsevat kulut. Kun aika koittaa, tapahtumat voidaan viedä yrityksesi käyttämään kirjanpitojärjestelmään.",
    "Will Pleo work with our accounting software?": "Toimiiko Pleo kirjanpito-ohjelmistomme kanssa?",
    "It’s very likely. Pleo can be connected to most accounting systems. We have direct integrations with Xero, QuickBooks, DATEV, e-conomic and more. Our customised CSV export functionality works well in many other cases. More on integrations.": "Erittäin todennäköisesti. Pleo voidaan yhdistää useimpiin kirjanpitojärjestelmiin. Meillä on suorat integraatiot Xeron, QuickBooksin, DATEVin, e-conomicin ja muiden vastaavien kanssa. Mukautettu CSV-vientitoimintomme toimii hyvin monissa muissa tapauksissa.

    "What is Pleo Fetch?": "Mikä on Pleo Fetch?",
    "Fetch pairs up the receipt in your Gmail, Outlook or Microsoft 365 inbox with the matching Pleo expense. Fetch doesn’t just search for receipts as they come in to your email account. It can sniff out any missing receipts from the last year and notify you when it’s done. Pleo doesn’t store your emails and Fetch will only retrieve messages that contain receipts. How Fetch works.": "Fetch liittää Gmailin, Outlookin tai Microsoft 365:n postilaatikossa olevan kuitin vastaavaan Pleo-kuluun. Fetch ei vain etsi kuitteja, kun ne saapuvat sähköpostitilillesi. Se voi jäljittää kaikki puuttuvat kuitit viime vuodelta ja ilmoittaa sinulle, kun se on valmis. Pleo ei tallenna sähköpostiviestejäsi, ja Fetch hakee vain kuitteja sisältävät viestit. Näin Fetch toimii.",
    "Fetch Page": "Fetch-sivu",
    "What is Pleo Pocket?": "Mikä on Pleo-tasku?",
    "Not every bit of business spending can be easily taken care of with a card, we know. Pleo Pocket is where you keep track of other expenses, like cash, out-of-pocket and mileage expenses. You enter the details and the amount involved, then Pleo will help your finance team to settle up what’s owed. If employees need to be reimbursed, we make that straightforward too. How Pocket works.": "Tiedämme, ettei kaikkia yrityksen kuluja voida hoitaa helposti kortilla. Pleo-tasku on paikka, jossa pidät kirjaa muista kuluista, kuten käteiskuluista, itse maksetuista kuluista ja kilometrikorvauksista. Syötät lisätiedot ja rahamäärän, ja Pleo auttaa taloustiimiäsi selvittämään velat. Jos työntekijöille on maksettava hyvityksiä, sekin käy helposti. Näin Tasku toimii.",
    "Pocket": "Tasku",
    "What is Pleo Assurance?": "Mikä on Pleo Assurance?",
    "Assurance brings an extra layer of control to your team’s spending without the tedium of approving every single expense. Managers can be alerted when an expense is made over a certain amount– and they can then decide if it’s OK or not. How Assurance works.": "Assurance tuo tiimisi kulutukseen lisää valvontaa ilman, että jokainen kulu pitäisi hyväksyä vaivalloisesti yksittäin. Esihenkilöt voivat saada ilmoituksen, kun kulu ylittää tietyn summan, ja päättää sitten, hyväksyvätkö he sen vai ei. Näin Assurance toimii.",

    "Security questions": "Tietoturvakysymykset",
    "Where are the funds being held?": "Missä varoja säilytetään?",
    "Every time you add funds to Pleo, that money comes out of your business bank account. But it doesn’t go directly to us. It goes first to J.P. Morgan, or to Danske Bank for our customers in Denmark and Sweden. This means that neither we – nor anyone else – have direct access to your money. When a transaction is made with a Pleo card and Mastercard looks for the funds to cover it, Pleo takes the money from J.P. Morgan or Danske Bank to pay it.": "Aina kun lisäät varoja Pleoon, rahat tulevat yrityksesi pankkitililtä. Ne eivät kuitenkaan tule suoraan meille. Ne menevät ensin J.P. Morganille tai Tanskan ja Ruotsin asiakkaidemme kohdalla Danske Bankille. Tämä tarkoittaa, ettei meillä eikä kellään muullakaan ole suoraa pääsyä rahoihisi. Kun Pleo-kortilla suoritetaan maksutapahtuma ja Mastercard hakee varat sen maksamiseen, Pleo ottaa rahat J.P. Morganilta tai Danske Bankilta maksua varten.",
    "J.P. Morgan and Danske Bank are both deemed to be Systemically Important Financial Institutions, in the US and Denmark respectively. That means that if something truly catastrophic happened, the central banks in the relevant countries would step in to ensure the survival of those institutions.": "J.P. Morgania pidetään Yhdysvalloissa ja Danske Bankia Tanskassa järjestelmän kannalta tärkeänä rahoituslaitoksena. Tämä tarkoittaa, että jos jotain todella katastrofaalista tapahtuisi, kyseisten maiden keskuspankit puuttuisivat asiaan varmistaakseen näiden laitosten selviytymisen.",
    "Plus, your transactions are handled by a separate licensed entity, Pleo Financial Services, regulated by the FSA in Denmark.": "Lisäksi tapahtumasi käsittelee erillinen lisensoitu yksikkö, Pleo Financial Services, jota Tanskan finanssivalvontaviranomainen sääntelee.",
    "What is Pleo’s fraud policy?": "Mikä on Pleon petostentorjuntakäytäntö?",
    "All Pleo purchases are monitored by fraud detection algorithms which will temporarily block your card in case of suspicious activity. You will be informed via a push notification or email if your card has been blocked, along with information on the suspicious transaction. If you recognise the transaction, you can enable your card from the web app. ": "Kaikkia Pleo-ostoksia valvotaan petoksen tunnistusalgoritmeilla, jotka sulkevat korttisi tilapäisesti, jos kortilla on epäilyttävää toimintaa. Jos korttisi on suljettu, saat push-ilmoituksella tai sähköpostitse ilmoituksen asiasta sekä tiedot epäilyttävästä tapahtumasta. Jos tunnistat tapahtuman, voit ottaa korttisi käyttöön verkkoapista.",
    "As well as enabling the card, you too can block your card immediately from the Pleo web app if you notice a suspicious transaction. In case of fraud you are covered by our Mastercard Zero Liability Policy. Find out more about Zero Liability Protection.": "Kortin käyttöönoton lisäksi voit myös sulkea korttisi välittömästi Pleo-verkkoapissa, jos huomaat epäilyttävän maksutapahtuman. Petostapauksissa turvanasi on Mastercardin Zero Liability -vastuusuoja. Lue lisää Zero Liability -vastuusuojasta.",
    "How will our data be protected?": "Miten tietojamme suojataan?",
    "We take security very seriously. Our cardholder data is protected by bank-level data encryption and is stored in a PCIDSS level-1 compliant data centre in the EEA. All data passed between our servers and third parties is 2048-bit SSL encrypted. Card transactions data is transmitted via VPN-tunnels to a certified PCIDSS level-1 processor.": "Suhtaudumme tietoturvaan erittäin vakavasti. Kortinhaltijoiden tiedot on suojattu pankkitason salauksella, ja ne on tallennetaan PCIDSS-tason 1 vaatimusten mukaiseen tietokeskukseen Euroopan talousalueella. Kaikki palvelimiemme ja kolmansien osapuolten välillä siirrettävät tiedot on salattu 2048-bittisellä SSL-salauksella. Korttitapahtumatiedot siirretään VPN-tunnelien kautta sertifioituun PCIDSS-tason 1 prosessoriin.",
    "Is Pleo PSD2 compliant?": "Noudattaako Pleo PSD2-direktiiviä?",
    "We are. We’ve worked hard to meet the highest standards of payment and data security, including Payment Services Directive 2. For existing customers, this will mean some changes in how you log in to Pleo. How PSD2 works.": "Kyllä. Olemme tehneet kovasti töitä täyttääksemme korkeimmat maksu- ja tietoturvastandardit, toinen maksupalveludirektiivi (PSD2) mukaan lukien.
